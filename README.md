# MindfulDBT — Product Showcase

Public-facing product overview for **MindfulDBT**, a skills-based therapy companion app designed to help users **learn, practice, and apply evidence-based emotional regulation techniques** in real-world moments of distress.

This repository intentionally focuses on **product vision, target audience, architectural thinking, and development philosophy** without exposing proprietary implementation details.

---

## What MindfulDBT Is

MindfulDBT is a digital companion grounded in **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)** principles. It is designed to bridge the gap between:

- learning therapeutic concepts, and  
- applying those skills during emotionally dysregulated moments  

The app emphasizes **guided skill selection**, **context-aware support**, and **progressive learning**, rather than passive content consumption.

---

## Target Audience

MindfulDBT is designed for:

- Individuals actively learning DBT skills (self-directed or in therapy)
- Users seeking structured emotional regulation tools during moments of distress
- People who benefit from step-by-step, skills-based guidance rather than open-ended journaling alone

Secondary audiences include:

- Therapists evaluating digital skill-support tools
- Product and engineering leaders interested in health-tech UX patterns
- Employers or partners exploring mental health enablement platforms

## What This Repository Is (and Is Not)

### This repository **is**:
- A public-facing product and architectural showcase
- Documentation of product philosophy and decision-making
- A high-level view into how the system is structured conceptually
- A safe artifact to share publicly or professionally

### This repository **is not**:
- The full application source code
- A deployable or runnable implementation
- A substitute for the private development repository
- A consumer-ready application

---

## Product Philosophy

MindfulDBT is built around a few core beliefs:

- **Respect the user’s cognitive load** — especially during distress  
- **Favor clarity over cleverness** — explicit beats implicit  
- **Guide, don’t overwhelm** — users should never face a blank state  
- **Design for regulation, not productivity**  
- **Build for longevity**, not novelty  

These principles influence everything from navigation and color usage to data modeling and feature prioritization.

---

## High-Level Architecture (Conceptual)

At a conceptual level, the system is designed around:

- **Skill-first navigation**, rather than feature-first navigation  
- A separation between:
  - content (skills, explanations, prompts)
  - state (user context, distress signals, progress)
  - guidance logic (what to surface, when, and why)
- Progressive disclosure — complexity is revealed only when helpful

Specific implementation details are intentionally excluded from this repository.

---

## Status

MindfulDBT is an **actively evolving product**, not a demo.

- Core application logic and data models are under private development
- This repository evolves alongside the product to reflect direction and thinking
- Documentation here may change as the product matures

---

## Why This Repository Exists

This repository exists to:

- Communicate product intent clearly and professionally
- Provide transparency without compromising IP
- Serve as a reference point for discussions around:
  - digital mental health UX
  - skills-based intervention design
  - applied emotional regulation tools
